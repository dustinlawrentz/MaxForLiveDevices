All Max For Live devices I make and am willing to show to the world

# UnrealPanner

This device lets you pan in a different and more lively way than the build in Ableton panning algorithm. 
It not only changes the volume of each channel induvidually, it also delays the "more distant" channel by a few microsecond and filters it. This makes the sound appear more dramatically to one side.
You can adjust the intensity of each of these effects and it has a build in sine wave LFO.


# ChordPitcher

This is a Max for Live audio effect that can repitch a sound to 4 different ratios in real time(from -48st to 48st). 
So you can add this effect over a monophonic sound and make it sound like a chord instantly. 

All of this is automatable.
It also features some built in chord presets, these presets use the first voice as root note.
Also it has a seperate frequency shifter for each voice.

One thing to note is that the device can have a bit of latency when the used ratios are very large.

# Tails

This is a device that automatically records its input whenever you pause Ableton. Effectively recording the tails of your Live set. This way you can save your beautiful audio tails and reuse them in creative ways. 

I recommend putting this device on your master channel.

You can save a file to .aiff .wav and some other formats by pressing the "Save buffer" button after recording a tail. This will open a folder selector window.

# Looper

This device is a simple yet effective audio effect to easily loop live incoming audio. You can tune recorded buffers up or down by a maximum of two octaves and you can change the speed from +2 (forward playing at double speed) to -2 (double speed playing backwards). You can also select transient mode; this mode will start recording in the buffer whenever a transient is detected. This way fluid re-recordings can happen. This is also interesting when using drumloops
